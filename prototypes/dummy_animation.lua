-- We need to simulate a fire on the dummy position so it doesn't look awkward if
-- turrets shoot at a dummy that apparently doesn't mark fire (could be in the
-- second phase, where the flame isn't visible anymore)

-- This won't be used in version 1.0.3! We're using real fire now, created whenever
-- a fire dummy is spawned! I'll keep this file for now, let's see if the new
-- method has any unintended side effects.
